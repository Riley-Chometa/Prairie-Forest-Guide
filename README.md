# Prairie-Forest-Guide
Prairie Forest Guide is a mobile application developed during a year-long projects class at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. It allows users to view “digital signs” placed at specific locations on a map when they are nearby. An admin panel web app enables FSAAI to manage and place these signs.
